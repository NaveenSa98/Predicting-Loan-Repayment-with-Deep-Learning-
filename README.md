# Predicting Loan Repayment with Deep Learning üöÄ

Welcome to my **Loan Repayment Prediction** project! This project leverages historical loan data from **LendingClub**, the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform, to build a deep learning model that predicts whether a borrower will repay their loan or default. The goal is to help financial institutions assess the risk of future borrowers and make informed lending decisions.

## üìã Project Overview

### **Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to predict whether a borrower will repay their loan (`Fully Paid`) or default (`Charged Off`). This is a **binary classification problem** aimed at improving risk assessment in peer-to-peer lending.

### **Dataset**
The dataset contains historical loan data from LendingClub, including features such as:
- Loan amount
- Interest rate
- Employment length
- Annual income
- Loan purpose
- And more...

The target variable is the `loan_status` column, which indicates whether the loan was repaid or charged off.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Analyzed the dataset to understand feature distributions and identify patterns.
   - Visualized key insights using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
   - Normalized numerical features for better model performance.

3. **Model Building**  
   - Designed and trained a **deep neural network** using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
   - Experimented with different architectures and hyperparameters to optimize performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated the model using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC**.
   - Generated a confusion matrix to visualize model performance.

5. **Feature Importance**  
   - Identified the most influential features in predicting loan repayment, such as interest rate, loan amount, and employment length.

## üöÄ Why This Matters

Predicting loan repayment is crucial for financial institutions to:
- **Reduce risk** by identifying high-risk borrowers.
- **Improve lending strategies** by making data-driven decisions.
- **Enhance customer trust** by offering fair and informed loan terms.
